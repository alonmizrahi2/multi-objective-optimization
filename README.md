# Multi_Objective_Optimization

This project presents a multi-objective optimization problem, in nature-inspired algorithms, NSGA2, MOEA\D.

In this project, the optimization problem is finding an optimal architecture for an artificial neural network, so that the structure of the network is as small as possible, and the accuracy of the network is as large as possible. (The construction of the network was carried out using the TensorFlow library)

Pareto front for 3 objectives (number of network parameters, accuracy, training epochs)
